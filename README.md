            Matchmaker: Conner Edition
______________________________________________________

This program is meant to find out how compatible as people 
you and me are. Maybe you'll be my friend, maybe we'll 
fall in love, or maybe I'll absolutely despise you. Below 
you will be presented with 5 different questions. You'll 
need to answer with a number 1-5. 1 would mean strongly 
disagree, 2 would mean disagree, 3 would be neutral, 4 
would be agree, and 5 would be strongly agree. After 
each question you will be told your compatibility score 
for that question. At the end it will tell you our total 
compatibility!

I hope you're my soulmate!
